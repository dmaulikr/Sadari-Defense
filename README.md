# Sadari Defense

A twist on the Sadari game of ladders. Protect your dot towers while taking down the enemies towers.

## Requirements

### Build

Xcode 8, iOS 10.0 SDK

### Runtime

iOS 10.0

## Gameplay

Sadari Defense is a ladder game played between two players. The playing field consists of five lanes. The outermost two lanes loop to the other side, meaning when a piece exits the lane at the bottom of the screen, it will reappear at the top. The center three lanes terminate at the players' dot towers. Dot towers can send out dots towards the enemy's dot towers. The dot will follow the line down the lane, and must fork at each rung if there is one. Each side has three rungs to place in between lanes that recharge over time.

When a dot tower sends out a dot, it must take time to recharge before another dot can be sent out.
